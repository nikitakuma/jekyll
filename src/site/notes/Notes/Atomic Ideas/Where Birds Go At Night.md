It was very weird, I thought I saw a bird sitting on a telephone wire really late at night. As I got closer, I realized it was just a breaker box or some part on the wire. Soon after wondering where birds go at night, I saw an owl swoop through the trees.  [[2023-07-04\|2023-07-04]]

# Most Birds are Diurnal
Obviously, there are birds like the [[Owl\|Owl]], but there are other nocturnal birds like  like the [[Frogmouths\|Frogmouths]], [[Nighthawks\|Nighthawks]] and [[Night-Herons\|Night-Herons]].

But [[Diurnal\|Diurnal]] birds mean they are more active during the day. Many of them do sleep at night. Some sing at night to take advantage of the silence, and some migrate at night to avoid the predators of the day. [^1] 

# Where/How Do Birds Sleep? 
They actually do not normally sleep in nests unless they are incubating eggs/raising young. Instead they sleep:
+ Inside cavities and niches that are hard to find/enter
+ High in trees, by the trunk for warmth and hearing vibrations (small birds)
+ Floating with a group in the water listening to the water for predators ([[Ducks\|Ducks]], [[Geese\|Geese]], [[Waterfowl\|Waterfowl]])
+ Standing in water, also listening to the water ([[Heron\|Heron]], [[Flamingos\|Flamingos]], [[Egrets\|Egrets]])
+ With large roosts of many birds, with some keeping guard ([[Red-winged Blackbird\|Red-winged Blackbird]], others)   [^2]
> A common theme is that [[There is safety in numbers\|There is safety in numbers]] 
## How do they not Fall out of Trees?
For perching birds, their muscles and tendons are arranged so that their "toes" naturally curl around the branch without any muscle effort. Their ankle bends after landing, the [[Achilles' Tendon\|Achilles' Tendon]] is stretched and pulls the toes to curl them. [^3]

## How do they Balance While Standing and Sleeping?
Flamingos actually exert less muscle force AND hold a steadier position while asleep, where they typically balance on one leg. Scientists tested this phenomenon with a dead bird and found that the leg joints lock in place, preventing the knee from flexing, yet letting the joint fully extend. It's a passive locking mechanism. [^4]

# What about the Cold?
Birds have clearly done something right to live as long as they have. But they can die from [[Hypothermia\|Hypothermia]], [[Frostbite\|Frostbite]], etc.
+ [[Hummingbirds\|Hummingbirds]] and other types of birds can go into a state of torpor, like [[Hibernation\|Hibernation]]. Their metabolism slows and body temperature lowers
+ Groups can share body heat, but can accidentally smother other birds
+ They tuck their bills into their shoulder/back, where their nostrils (nares) can get warm air in their plumage
+ They can fluff their feathers to make air pockets to insulate
