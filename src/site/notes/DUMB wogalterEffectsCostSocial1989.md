> [!abstract]-
> The behavioral effects of cost and social influence on warning compliance were examined. Participants in several studies performed a chemistry laboratory task using a set of instructions that contained a warning directing them to wear a safety mask and gloves. Cost was manipulated by locating the masks and gloves in either an accessible location (low cost) or a less accessible location (high cost); social influence was manipulated by the presence of a confederate who either did or did not comply with the warning. The results showed reduced compliance with the warning when the cost was high and that the compliance rate was biased up or down depending on the behavior of the confederate. The results from a field study confirmed the social influence effect. Implications of this research for facilitating warning effectiveness and safety are discussed.

>[!introduction]-
> > [!starred]- People often use the behavior of others to infer the appropriate action for a given situa- tion (Asch, 1955) (pg 2)[**⮭**](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TFBGJTV2?page=2&annotation=7ZANIK79)

> > [!starred]- The social influence heuristic implies that in a situation involving compliance with a warning instruction, we will be more likely to comply with the warning when others are doing so than when others are not.

> > [!starred]- The magnitude of the social effect suggests that a potent way to affect compliance is through training that involves behavior modeling. Showing people what to do is probably much more effective than merely telling people what to do. Compliance will be facilitated when others in the hazardous situation model the appropriate behavior.
